    It will be used as soon as we connect to the p2p network. New transactions and blocks will be
    downloaded and connected to our DAG, but no inconsistency will be allowed.

    Syncing algorithm
    -----------------

    1. Send GET-TIPS
    2. Recv TIPS

    Then, if we don't know any block, run:

    3. Send GET-BLOCKS
    4. Recv BLOCKS

    Repeat steps 3 and 4 until we get a known block.

    For each block, do:

        5. Send GET-TRANSACTIONS
        6. Recv TRANSACTIONS

        Repeat steps 5 and 6 until we get a known transaction.

        7. Send GET-DATA
        8. Recv DATA

        Repeat steps 7 and 8 until all transactions have been downloaded.

    Now, all blocks are sync'ed. Thus,

    9. Send GET-TIPS
    10. Recv TIPS

    If there is any tip we don't know, we run:

    11. Send GET-TRANSACTIONS
    12. Recv TRANSACTIONS

    Repeat steps 11 and 12 until we get a known transactions.

    13. Send GET-DATA
    14. Recv DATA

    Repeat steps 13 and 14 until all transactions have been downloaded.

    15. GET-TIP
    16. TIP

    Probably we are sync'ed. But, if something new has appeared, do it again.
