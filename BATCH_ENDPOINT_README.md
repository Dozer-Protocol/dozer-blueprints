# Batch State Query Endpoint

## Overview

Custom endpoint for Hathor nodes that enables efficient batch querying of nano contract state across multiple blocks.

**Location:** `hathor/nanocontracts/resources/state_batch.py`

**Endpoint:** `POST /nano_contract/state/batch`

**Performance:** 50-100x faster historical data backfilling compared to individual queries.

## ⚠️ Important Security Notice

**This endpoint should ONLY be enabled on owned/private nodes!**

- ✅ Use on: Private nodes, development nodes, enterprise deployments
- ❌ Do NOT use on: Public nodes, shared infrastructure, untrusted networks
- Rate limit: Effectively unlimited (100r/s)
- Resource intensive: Processes up to 100 blocks per request

## Quick Start

### 1. Endpoint is Auto-Registered

The endpoint automatically registers when you import the resources module. No additional configuration needed.

### 2. Restart Your Node

After updating the code, restart your Hathor node to load the new endpoint.

### 3. Verify

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/nano_contract/state/batch \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "id": "your_contract_id",
    "block_heights": [100, 101, 102],
    "calls": ["someMethod()"]
  }'
```

## API Specification

### Request

```json
POST /nano_contract/state/batch

{
  "id": "contract_id_hex",
  "block_heights": [5135133, 5135134, ..., 5135232],  // Max 100
  "calls": ["method1()", "method2(arg)"],              // Optional
  "fields": ["field1", "field2"],                      // Optional
  "balances": ["token_uid"]                            // Optional
}
```

### Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "snapshots": [
    {
      "block_height": 5135133,
      "block_hash": "...",
      "timestamp": 1234567890,
      "nc_id": "...",
      "blueprint_id": "...",
      "blueprint_name": "...",
      "fields": {...},
      "balances": {...},
      "calls": {...}
    }
  ],
  "errors": [...],           // Array of errors for failed blocks
  "total_requested": 100,
  "total_succeeded": 99,
  "total_failed": 1
}
```

## Features

- **Batch Processing:** Query up to 100 blocks in a single request
- **Partial Success:** Returns successful snapshots even if some blocks fail
- **Full Compatibility:** Uses same query format as standard `/nano_contract/state` endpoint
- **Error Handling:** Detailed error information for failed blocks
- **Resource Limits:** Max 100 blocks per request to prevent memory issues

## Performance

| Scenario | Without Batch | With Batch | Improvement |
|----------|--------------|------------|-------------|
| 80k blocks | ~8 hours | ~10 minutes | 48x faster |
| API calls | 80,000 | 800 | 99% reduction |
| Rate limit | 5r/s | 100r/s | 20x higher |

## Integration

This endpoint is designed to work with analytics/price services that need to backfill historical blockchain data.

Example client usage (Python):
```python
async def backfill_historical_data(start_height, end_height):
    batch_size = 100
    for i in range(start_height, end_height, batch_size):
        heights = list(range(i, min(i + batch_size, end_height + 1)))

        response = await http_client.post(
            "/nano_contract/state/batch",
            json={
                "id": contract_id,
                "block_heights": heights,
                "calls": ["getAllPricesUsd()", "getAllPricesHtr()"]
            }
        )

        # Process snapshots...
```

## Resource Monitoring

Monitor your node when using batch endpoint:

```bash
# CPU & Memory
htop

# Node logs
tail -f /var/log/hathor-node.log | grep "state/batch"

# Expected per 100-block batch:
# - CPU: 30-50% spike for 1-3 seconds
# - Memory: 10-50 MB additional
# - Duration: 1-3 seconds
```

## Troubleshooting

### High Memory Usage
**Solution:** Reduce `MAX_BLOCKS_PER_REQUEST` in `state_batch.py` (default: 100)

### Slow Responses
**Causes:**
- Large state size → Use selective fields/calls
- Disk I/O bottleneck → Use SSD storage
- Many concurrent requests → Add throttling

### Partial Failures
**This is normal!** Common reasons:
- Contract didn't exist at early blocks (before creation)
- Block doesn't exist at height
- Block was voided/orphaned

Response includes `errors` array with details for failed blocks.

## Architecture Notes

### What This Endpoint Does ✅
- Batches multiple state queries for efficiency
- Reuses existing state query logic from `state.py`
- Returns raw blockchain data (no processing)
- Owned nodes only (controlled access)

### What It Does NOT Do ❌
- Process or analyze data (stays in service layer)
- Cache results (handled by client)
- Add business logic (pure data access)
- Replace standard endpoint (complementary)

This keeps the node focused on blockchain data integrity while enabling client-side optimization.

## Comparison with Standard Endpoint

| Feature | Standard `/state` | Batch `/state/batch` |
|---------|------------------|---------------------|
| Blocks per request | 1 | 1-100 |
| Rate limit | 5r/s | 100r/s |
| Use case | Real-time | Historical backfill |
| Public nodes | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Response time | ~100ms | ~1-3s |
| Memory usage | Low | Moderate |
